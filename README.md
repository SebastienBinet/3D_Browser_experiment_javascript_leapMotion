# 3D_Browser_experiment_javascript_leapMotion
On July 2015, I (Sebastien Binet) have coded this experiment to test my concept of 3D browser with Leap Motion.

However I stopped coding because javascript is not the best language for this experiment.

Open index.html in your browser and connect the Leap Motion device.

Usage: With your right hand, grab the "VR" level and navigate to it. Now grab the sub-level "WebVR", and you then be able to open "mozvr" leaf.

Note: some internmittent bugs sometime freeze the browser.
